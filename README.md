# Company Dashboard GXT sample migrated to Vaadin

This is the Apache 2.0 licensed version of sample at
https://github.com/johannesh2/company-dashboard-migration. 
This is not a fully functional example, because the GPLv3 licensed GXT sample
code is stripped away.

Demonstration on how to migrate a an existing GXT application to Vaadin with minimal 
required steps. Existing functionality continues working as is, and the new
functionality should be developed using Vaadin Framework's server-side approach.
This sample project gives some guidance, but every migration project should be 
considered case-by-case.
